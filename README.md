# covid19-tweets

Track information dissemination about COVID-19 by local government agencies

Created by Irena Fischer-Hwang (<ihwang@stanford.edu>)

## Project goal

Stanford University's Big Local News project performed basic analysis of Tweets posted by local government agencies in the United States regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.

This notebook pulls in data from a variety of sources including an exported CSV of Tweets, a Google Sheet containing government agency twitter handles, a Google Sheet summarizing shelter-in-place orders for different states and The Covid Tracking project. Data are summarized and displayed in simple plots comparing quantities like cumulative tweets, cumulative tweets regarding COVID-19, retweets, shelter-in-place orders and basic statistics about confirmed COVID-19 cases.
